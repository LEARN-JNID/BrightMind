                    Zencare started as a solution to a common problem: it's
                    difficult to find a great-fitting therapist through an
                    online search.Founder Yuri Tomikawa began Zencare after
                    spending weeks looking for the right therapist. Our goal is
                    to remove the guesswork and logistical hassle from the
                    therapist search, providing a smooth and empowering
                    experience.
